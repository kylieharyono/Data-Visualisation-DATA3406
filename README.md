# Human-in-the-Loop Data Analysis: Ethics in Personal Data

## Description

This project investigates the ethics of using step count data to analyse physical activity patterns while considering privacy concerns. We explored the challenges of defining and interpreting "moderate activity" across different users and how data should be anonymized, binned, and handled. The primary goal was to assess whether individuals achieve the recommended 30 minutes of moderate physical activity most days of the week, while also accounting for the impact of non-wear versus actual inactivity. Ethical considerations, such as how much personal data should be shared and the role of informed consent, were also discussed.

## Techniques & Tools

- Data Preprocessing: Anonymisation, data binning, handling missing or incomplete data
- Analysis: Data visualisation, defining driving questions around activity thresholds
- Tools: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), Jupyter Notebooks

## Contributions:

This repository contains results of a group project. There are three main parts to this project:
- Data Cleaning, Exploration, and Visualisation: Individual work.
- Individual Analysis & Visualisation: Individual work.
- Final Product Notebook: This was group work, which was mainly authored by Dean Li, and contributed by Yiping Su, Harshil Sindhi, and Kylie Haryono.

## Acknowledgments: 

The group work was initially done by Andy Chen, Dean Li, Harshil Sindhi, Samuel Tsui, and Kylie Haryono as part of the DATA3406 (Data with Human-in-the-Loop Analysis) course by University of Sydney, which included raw data as part of the course. This repository was then modified by Kylie Haryono.
